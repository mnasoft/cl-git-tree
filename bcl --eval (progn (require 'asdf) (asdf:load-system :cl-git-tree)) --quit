       [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m --all [<options>]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, "refs") from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their
       histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated (see the description of <refspec> below for ways to control this behavior).

       By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that you
       are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using the --tags or --no-tags options or by configuring remote.<name>.tagOpt. By
       using a refspec that fetches tags explicitly, you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested in as well.

       [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m can fetch from either a single named repository or URL, or from several repositories at once if <group> is given and there is a
       remotes.<group> entry in the configuration file. (See [1mgit-config[22m(1)).

       When no remote is specified, by default the [1morigin [22mremote will be used, unless there’s an upstream branch configured for the current branch.

       The names of refs that are fetched, together with the object names they point at, are written to [1m.git/FETCH_HEAD[22m. This information may be used
       by scripts or other git commands, such as [1mgit-pull[22m(1).

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       --all, --no-all
           Fetch all remotes, except for the ones that has the [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.skipFetchAll [22mconfiguration variable set. This overrides the
           configuration variable [1mfetch.all[22m.

       -a, --append
           Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the existing contents of [1m.git/FETCH_HEAD[22m. Without this option old data in
           [1m.git/FETCH_HEAD [22mwill be overwritten.

       --atomic
           Use an atomic transaction to update local refs. Either all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated.

       --depth=<depth>
           Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from the tip of each remote branch history. If fetching to a [4mshallow[24m repository created
           by [1mgit clone [22mwith [1m--depth=[4m[22m<depth>[24m option (see [1mgit-clone[22m(1)), deepen or shorten the history to the specified number of commits. Tags for
           the deepened commits are not fetched.

       --deepen=<depth>
           Similar to --depth, except it specifies the number of commits from the current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each remote
           branch history.

       --shallow-since=<date>
           Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to include all reachable commits after <date>.

       --shallow-exclude=<ref>
           Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag. This option can
           be specified multiple times.

       --unshallow
           If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations imposed by shallow
           repositories.

           If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so that the current repository has the same history as the source
           repository.

       --update-shallow
           By default when fetching from a shallow repository, [1mgit fetch [22mrefuses refs that require updating .git/shallow. This option updates
           .git/shallow and accepts such refs.

       --negotiation-tip=<commit|glob>
           By default, Git will report, to the server, commits reachable from all local refs to find common commits in an attempt to reduce the size
           of the to-be-received packfile. If specified, Git will only report commits reachable from the given tips. This is useful to speed up
           fetches when the user knows which local ref is likely to have commits in common with the upstream ref being fetched.

           This option may be specified more than once; if so, Git will report commits reachable from any of the given commits.

           The argument to this option may be a glob on ref names, a ref, or the (possibly abbreviated) SHA-1 of a commit. Specifying a glob is
           equivalent to specifying this option multiple times, one for each matching ref name.

           See also the [1mfetch.negotiationAlgorithm [22mand [1mpush.negotiate [22mconfiguration variables documented in [1mgit-config[22m(1), and the [1m--negotiate-only[0m
           option below.

       --negotiate-only
           Do not fetch anything from the server, and instead print the ancestors of the provided [1m--negotiation-tip=* [22marguments, which we have in
           common with the server.

           This is incompatible with [1m--recurse-submodules=[22m[[1myes[22m|[1mon-demand[22m]. Internally this is used to implement the [1mpush.negotiate [22moption, see [1mgit-[0m
           [1mconfig[22m(1).

       --dry-run
           Show what would be done, without making any changes.

       --porcelain
           Print the output to standard output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. See section OUTPUT in [1mgit-fetch[22m(1) for details.

           This is incompatible with [1m--recurse-submodules=[22m[[1myes[22m|[1mon-demand[22m] and takes precedence over the [1mfetch.output [22mconfig option.

       --write-fetch-head, --no-write-fetch-head
           Write the list of remote refs fetched in the [1mFETCH_HEAD [22mfile directly under [1m$GIT_DIR[22m. This is the default. Passing [1m--no-write-fetch-head[0m
           from the command line tells Git not to write the file. Under [1m--dry-run [22moption, the file is never written.

       -f, --force
           When [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m is used with [4m<src>[24m[1m:[4m[22m<dst>[24m refspec, it may refuse to update the local branch as discussed in the [4m<refspec>[24m part below. This
           option overrides that check.

       -k, --keep
           Keep downloaded pack.

       --multiple
           Allow several <repository> and <group> arguments to be specified. No <refspec>s may be specified.

       --auto-maintenance, --no-auto-maintenance, --auto-gc, --no-auto-gc
           Run [1mgit maintenance run --auto [22mat the end to perform automatic repository maintenance if needed. ([1m--[22m[[1mno-[22m][1mauto-gc [22mis a synonym.) This is
           enabled by default.

       --write-commit-graph, --no-write-commit-graph
           Write a commit-graph after fetching. This overrides the config setting [1mfetch.writeCommitGraph[22m.

       --prefetch
           Modify the configured refspec to place all refs into the [1mrefs/prefetch/ [22mnamespace. See the [1mprefetch [22mtask in [1mgit-maintenance[22m(1).

       -p, --prune
           Before fetching, remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote. Tags are not subject to pruning if they are
           fetched only because of the default tag auto-following or due to a --tags option. However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec
           (either on the command line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote was cloned with the --mirror option), then they are
           also subject to pruning. Supplying [1m--prune-tags [22mis a shorthand for providing the tag refspec.

           See the PRUNING section below for more details.

       -P, --prune-tags
           Before fetching, remove any local tags that no longer exist on the remote if [1m--prune [22mis enabled. This option should be used more
           carefully, unlike [1m--prune [22mit will remove any local references (local tags) that have been created. This option is a shorthand for
           providing the explicit tag refspec along with [1m--prune[22m, see the discussion about that in its documentation.

           See the PRUNING section below for more details.

       -n, --no-tags
           By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally. This option disables
           this automatic tag following. The default behavior for a remote may be specified with the remote.<name>.tagOpt setting. See [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       --refetch
           Instead of negotiating with the server to avoid transferring commits and associated objects that are already present locally, this option
           fetches all objects as a fresh clone would. Use this to reapply a partial clone filter from configuration or using [1m--filter= [22mwhen the
           filter definition has changed. Automatic post-fetch maintenance will perform object database pack consolidation to remove any duplicate
           objects.

       --refmap=<refspec>
           When fetching refs listed on the command line, use the specified refspec (can be given more than once) to map the refs to remote-tracking
           branches, instead of the values of [1mremote.*.fetch [22mconfiguration variables for the remote repository. Providing an empty [4m<refspec>[24m to the
           [1m--refmap [22moption causes Git to ignore the configured refspecs and rely entirely on the refspecs supplied as command-line arguments. See
           section on "Configured Remote-tracking Branches" for details.

       -t, --tags
           Fetch all tags from the remote (i.e., fetch remote tags [1mrefs/tags/* [22minto local tags with the same name), in addition to whatever else
           would otherwise be fetched. Using this option alone does not subject tags to pruning, even if --prune is used (though tags may be pruned
           anyway if they are also the destination of an explicit refspec; see [1m--prune[22m).

       --recurse-submodules[=(yes|on-demand|no)]
           This option controls if and under what conditions new commits of submodules should be fetched too. When recursing through submodules, [1mgit[0m
           [1mfetch [22malways attempts to fetch "changed" submodules, that is, a submodule that has commits that are referenced by a newly fetched
           superproject commit but are missing in the local submodule clone. A changed submodule can be fetched as long as it is present locally e.g.
           in [1m$GIT_DIR/modules/ [22m(see [1mgitsubmodules[22m(7)); if the upstream adds a new submodule, that submodule cannot be fetched until it is cloned
           e.g. by [1mgit submodule update[22m.

           When set to [4mon-demand[24m, only changed submodules are fetched. When set to [4myes[24m, all populated submodules are fetched and submodules that are
           both unpopulated and changed are fetched. When set to [4mno[24m, submodules are never fetched.

           When unspecified, this uses the value of [1mfetch.recurseSubmodules [22mif it is set (see [1mgit-config[22m(1)), defaulting to [4mon-demand[24m if unset. When
           this option is used without any value, it defaults to [4myes[24m.

       -j, --jobs=<n>
           Number of parallel children to be used for all forms of fetching.

           If the [1m--multiple [22moption was specified, the different remotes will be fetched in parallel. If multiple submodules are fetched, they will
           be fetched in parallel. To control them independently, use the config settings [1mfetch.parallel [22mand [1msubmodule.fetchJobs [22m(see [1mgit-config[22m(1)).

           Typically, parallel recursive and multi-remote fetches will be faster. By default fetches are performed sequentially, not in parallel.

       --no-recurse-submodules
           Disable recursive fetching of submodules (this has the same effect as using the [1m--recurse-submodules=no [22moption).

       --set-upstream
           If the remote is fetched successfully, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less [1mgit-pull[22m(1) and other commands. For more
           information, see [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.merge [22mand [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.remote [22min [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       --submodule-prefix=<path>
           Prepend <path> to paths printed in informative messages such as "Fetching submodule foo". This option is used internally when recursing
           over submodules.

       --recurse-submodules-default=[yes|on-demand]
           This option is used internally to temporarily provide a non-negative default value for the --recurse-submodules option. All other methods
           of configuring fetch’s submodule recursion (such as settings in [1mgitmodules[22m(5) and [1mgit-config[22m(1)) override this option, as does specifying
           --[no-]recurse-submodules directly.

       -u, --update-head-ok
           By default [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m refuses to update the head which corresponds to the current branch. This flag disables the check. This is purely for
           the internal use for [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m to communicate with [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m, and unless you are implementing your own Porcelain you are not supposed to
           use it.

       --upload-pack <upload-pack>
           When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled by [4mgit[24m [4mfetch-pack[24m, [1m--exec=[4m[22m<upload-pack>[24m is passed to the command to specify
           non-default path for the command run on the other end.

       -q, --quiet
           Pass --quiet to git-fetch-pack and silence any other internally used git commands. Progress is not reported to the standard error stream.

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

       --progress
           Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This flag
           forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.

       -o <option>, --server-option=<option>
           Transmit the given string to the server when communicating using protocol version 2. The given string must not contain a NUL or LF
           character. The server’s handling of server options, including unknown ones, is server-specific. When multiple [1m--server-option=[4m[22m<option>[24m are
           given, they are all sent to the other side in the order listed on the command line. When no [1m--server-option=[4m[22m<option>[24m is given from the
           command line, the values of configuration variable [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.serverOption [22mare used instead.

       --show-forced-updates
           By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated during fetch. This can be disabled through fetch.showForcedUpdates, but the
           --show-forced-updates option guarantees this check occurs. See [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       --no-show-forced-updates
           By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated during fetch. Pass --no-show-forced-updates or set fetch.showForcedUpdates to false to
           skip this check for performance reasons. If used during [4mgit-pull[24m the --ff-only option will still check for forced updates before
           attempting a fast-forward update. See [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       -4, --ipv4
           Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.

       -6, --ipv6
           Use IPv6 addresses only, ignoring IPv4 addresses.

       <repository>
           The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch or pull operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS
           below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).

       <group>
           A name referring to a list of repositories as the value of remotes.<group> in the configuration file. (See [1mgit-config[22m(1)).

       <refspec>
           Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update. When no <refspec>s appear on the command line, the refs to fetch are read
           from [1mremote.[4m[22m<repository>[24m[1m.fetch [22mvariables instead (see CONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES below).

           The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus [1m+[22m, followed by the source <src>, followed by a colon [1m:[22m, followed by the
           destination <dst>. The colon can be omitted when <dst> is empty. <src> is typically a ref, or a glob pattern with a single [1m* [22mthat is used
           to match a set of refs, but it can also be a fully spelled hex object name.

           A <refspec> may contain a [1m* [22min its <src> to indicate a simple pattern match. Such a refspec functions like a glob that matches any ref
           with the pattern. A pattern <refspec> must have one and only one [1m* [22min both the <src> and <dst>. It will map refs to the destination by
           replacing the [1m* [22mwith the contents matched from the source.

           If a refspec is prefixed by [1m^[22m, it will be interpreted as a negative refspec. Rather than specifying which refs to fetch or which local
           refs to update, such a refspec will instead specify refs to exclude. A ref will be considered to match if it matches at least one positive
           refspec, and does not match any negative refspec. Negative refspecs can be useful to restrict the scope of a pattern refspec so that it
           will not include specific refs. Negative refspecs can themselves be pattern refspecs. However, they may only contain a <src> and do not
           specify a <dst>. Fully spelled out hex object names are also not supported.

           [1mtag [4m[22m<tag>[24m means the same as [1mrefs/tags/[4m[22m<tag>[24m[1m:refs/tags/[4m[22m<tag>[24m; it requests fetching everything up to the given tag.

           The remote ref that matches <src> is fetched, and if <dst> is not an empty string, an attempt is made to update the local ref that matches
           it.

           Whether that update is allowed without [1m--force [22mdepends on the ref namespace it’s being fetched to, the type of object being fetched, and
           whether the update is considered to be a fast-forward. Generally, the same rules apply for fetching as when pushing, see the [4m<refspec>[24m...
           section of [1mgit-push[22m(1) for what those are. Exceptions to those rules particular to [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m are noted below.

           Until Git version 2.20, and unlike when pushing with [1mgit-push[22m(1), any updates to [1mrefs/tags/* [22mwould be accepted without [1m+ [22min the refspec
           (or [1m--force[22m). When fetching, we promiscuously considered all tag updates from a remote to be forced fetches. Since Git version 2.20,
           fetching to update [1mrefs/tags/* [22mworks the same way as when pushing. I.e. any updates will be rejected without [1m+ [22min the refspec (or
           [1m--force[22m).

           Unlike when pushing with [1mgit-push[22m(1), any updates outside of [1mrefs/[22m{tags,heads}/* will be accepted without [1m+ [22min the refspec (or [1m--force[22m),
           whether that’s swapping e.g. a tree object for a blob, or a commit for another commit that doesn’t have the previous commit as an ancestor
           etc.

           Unlike when pushing with [1mgit-push[22m(1), there is no configuration which’ll amend these rules, and nothing like a [1mpre-fetch [22mhook analogous to
           the [1mpre-receive [22mhook.

           As with pushing with [1mgit-push[22m(1), all of the rules described above about what’s not allowed as an update can be overridden by adding an
           optional leading [1m+ [22mto a refspec (or using the [1m--force [22mcommand line option). The only exception to this is that no amount of forcing will
           make the [1mrefs/heads/* [22mnamespace accept a non-commit object.

               [1mNote[0m
               When the remote branch you want to fetch is known to be rewound and rebased regularly, it is expected that its new tip will not be a
               descendant of its previous tip (as stored in your remote-tracking branch the last time you fetched). You would want to use the [1m+ [22msign
               to indicate non-fast-forward updates will be needed for such branches. There is no way to determine or declare that a branch will be
               made available in a repository with this behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the expected usage pattern for a branch.

       --stdin
           Read refspecs, one per line, from stdin in addition to those provided as arguments. The "tag <name>" format is not supported.

[1mGIT URLS[0m
       In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
       on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.

       Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated;
       do not use them).

       The native transport (i.e. [1mgit:// [22mURL) does no authentication and should be used with caution on unsecured networks.

       The following syntaxes may be used with them:

       •   [1mssh://[22m[[4m<user>[24m[1m@[22m][4m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       •   [1mgit://[4m[22m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       •   [1mhttp[22m[[1ms[22m][1m://[4m[22m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       •   [1mftp[22m[[1ms[22m][1m://[4m[22m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

       •   [[4m<user>[24m[1m@[22m][4m<host>[24m[1m:/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon.
       For example the local path [1mfoo:bar [22mcould be specified as an absolute path or [1m./foo:bar [22mto avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.

       The ssh and git protocols additionally support [1m~[4m[22m<username>[24m expansion:

       •   [1mssh://[22m[[4m<user>[24m[1m@[22m][4m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/~[4m[22m<user>[24m[1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       •   [1mgit://[4m[22m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/~[4m[22m<user>[24m[1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       •   [[4m<user>[24m[1m@[22m][4m<host>[24m[1m:~[4m[22m<user>[24m[1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following syntaxes may be used:

       •   [1m/path/to/repo.git/[0m

       •   [1mfile:///path/to/repo.git/[0m

       These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when the former implies [1m--local [22moption. See [1mgit-clone[22m(1) for details.

       [1mgit clone[22m, [1mgit fetch [22mand [1mgit pull[22m, but not [1mgit push[22m, will also accept a suitable bundle file. See [1mgit-bundle[22m(1).

       When Git doesn’t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it attempts to use the [1mremote-[4m[22m<transport>[24m remote helper, if one exists. To
       explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may be used:

       •   [4m<transport>[24m[1m::[4m[22m<address>[0m

       where [4m<address>[24m may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked. See
       [1mgitremote-helpers[22m(7) for details.

       If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
       will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration section of the form:

                   [url "[4m<actual-url-base>[24m"]
                           insteadOf = [4m<other-url-base>[0m

       For example, with this:

                   [url "git://git.host.xz/"]
                           insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                           insteadOf = work:

       a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be
       "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

       If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a configuration section of the form:

                   [url "[4m<actual-url-base>[24m"]
                           pushInsteadOf = [4m<other-url-base>[0m

       For example, with this:

                   [url "ssh://example.org/"]
                           pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/

       a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to "ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still use
       the original URL.

[1mREMOTES[0m
       The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as [4m<repository>[24m argument:

       •   a remote in the Git configuration file: [1m$GIT_DIR/config[22m,

       •   a file in the [1m$GIT_DIR/remotes [22mdirectory, or

       •   a file in the [1m$GIT_DIR/branches [22mdirectory.

       All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line because they each contain a refspec which git will use by default.

   [1mNamed remote in configuration file[0m
       You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously configured using [1mgit-remote[22m(1), [1mgit-config[22m(1) or even by a manual edit
       to the [1m$GIT_DIR/config [22mfile. The URL of this remote will be used to access the repository. The refspec of this remote will be used by default
       when you do not provide a refspec on the command line. The entry in the config file would appear like this:

                   [remote "<name>"]
                           url = <URL>
                           pushurl = <pushurl>
                           push = <refspec>
                           fetch = <refspec>

       The [4m<pushurl>[24m is used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults to [4m<URL>[24m. Pushing to a remote affects all defined pushurls or all defined
       urls if no pushurls are defined. Fetch, however, will only fetch from the first defined url if multiple urls are defined.

   [1mNamed file in $GIT_DIR/remotes[0m
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in [1m$GIT_DIR/remotes[22m. The URL in this file will be used to access the repository. The refspec in
       this file will be used as default when you do not provide a refspec on the command line. This file should have the following format:

                   URL: one of the above URL formats
                   Push: <refspec>
                   Pull: <refspec>

       [1mPush: [22mlines are used by [4mgit[24m [4mpush[24m and [1mPull: [22mlines are used by [4mgit[24m [4mpull[24m and [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m. Multiple [1mPush: [22mand [1mPull: [22mlines may be specified for
       additional branch mappings.

   [1mNamed file in $GIT_DIR/branches[0m
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in [1m$GIT_DIR/branches[22m. The URL in this file will be used to access the repository. This file
       should have the following format:

                   <URL>#<head>

       [4m<URL>[24m is required; #[4m<head>[24m is optional.

       Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following refspecs, if you don’t provide one on the command line. [4m<branch>[24m is the name of
       this file in [1m$GIT_DIR/branches [22mand [4m<head>[24m defaults to [1mmaster[22m.

       git fetch uses:

                   refs/heads/<head>:refs/heads/<branch>

       git push uses:

                   HEAD:refs/heads/<head>

[1mUPSTREAM BRANCHES[0m
       Branches in Git can optionally have an upstream remote branch. Git defaults to using the upstream branch for remote operations, for example:

       •   It’s the default for [1mgit pull [22mor [1mgit fetch [22mwith no arguments.

       •   It’s the default for [1mgit push [22mwith no arguments, with some exceptions. For example, you can use the [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.pushRemote [22moption to
           push to a different remote than you pull from, and by default with [1mpush.default=simple [22mthe upstream branch you configure must have the
           same name.

       •   Various commands, including [1mgit checkout [22mand [1mgit status[22m, will show you how many commits have been added to your current branch and the
           upstream since you forked from it, for example "Your branch and [4morigin/main[24m have diverged, and have 2 and 3 different commits each
           respectively".

       The upstream is stored in [1m.git/config[22m, in the "remote" and "merge" fields. For example, if [1mmain[22m's upstream is [1morigin/main[22m:

           [branch "main"]
              remote = origin
              merge = refs/heads/main

       You can set an upstream branch explicitly with [1mgit push --set-upstream [4m[22m<remote>[24m [4m<branch>[24m but Git will often automatically set the upstream for
       you, for example:

       •   When you clone a repository, Git will automatically set the upstream for the default branch.

       •   If you have the [1mpush.autoSetupRemote [22mconfiguration option set, [1mgit push [22mwill automatically set the upstream the first time you push a
           branch.

       •   Checking out a remote-tracking branch with [1mgit checkout [4m[22m<branch>[24m will automatically create a local branch with that name and set the
           upstream to the remote branch.

           [1mNote[0m

           Upstream branches are sometimes referred to as "tracking information", as in "set the branch’s tracking information".

[1mCONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES[0m
       You often interact with the same remote repository by regularly and repeatedly fetching from it. In order to keep track of the progress of
       such a remote repository, [1mgit fetch [22mallows you to configure [1mremote.[4m[22m<repository>[24m[1m.fetch [22mconfiguration variables.

       Typically such a variable may look like this:

           [remote "origin"]
                   fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

       This configuration is used in two ways:

       •   When [1mgit fetch [22mis run without specifying what branches and/or tags to fetch on the command line, e.g.  [1mgit fetch origin [22mor [1mgit fetch[22m,
           [1mremote.[4m[22m<repository>[24m[1m.fetch [22mvalues are used as the refspecs—they specify which refs to fetch and which local refs to update. The example
           above will fetch all branches that exist in the [1morigin [22m(i.e. any ref that matches the left-hand side of the value, [1mrefs/heads/*[22m) and
           update the corresponding remote-tracking branches in the [1mrefs/remotes/origin/* [22mhierarchy.

       •   When [1mgit fetch [22mis run with explicit branches and/or tags to fetch on the command line, e.g.  [1mgit fetch origin master[22m, the <refspec>s given
           on the command line determine what are to be fetched (e.g.  [1mmaster [22min the example, which is a short-hand for [1mmaster:[22m, which in turn means
           "fetch the [4mmaster[24m branch but I do not explicitly say what remote-tracking branch to update with it from the command line"), and the
           example command will fetch [4monly[24m the [4mmaster[24m branch. The [1mremote.[4m[22m<repository>[24m[1m.fetch [22mvalues determine which remote-tracking branch, if any, is
           updated. When used in this way, the [1mremote.[4m[22m<repository>[24m[1m.fetch [22mvalues do not have any effect in deciding [4mwhat[24m gets fetched (i.e. the values
           are not used as refspecs when the command-line lists refspecs); they are only used to decide [4mwhere[24m the refs that are fetched are stored by
           acting as a mapping.

       The latter use of the [1mremote.[4m[22m<repository>[24m[1m.fetch [22mvalues can be overridden by giving the [1m--refmap=[4m[22m<refspec>[24m parameter(s) on the command line.

[1mPRUNING[0m
       Git has a default disposition of keeping data unless it’s explicitly thrown away; this extends to holding onto local references to branches on
       remotes that have themselves deleted those branches.

       If left to accumulate, these stale references might make performance worse on big and busy repos that have a lot of branch churn, and e.g.
       make the output of commands like [1mgit branch -a --contains [4m[22m<commit>[24m needlessly verbose, as well as impacting anything else that’ll work with
       the complete set of known references.

       These remote-tracking references can be deleted as a one-off with either of:

           # While fetching
           $ git fetch --prune <name>

           # Only prune, don't fetch
           $ git remote prune <name>

       To prune references as part of your normal workflow without needing to remember to run that, set [1mfetch.prune [22mglobally, or [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.prune[0m
       per-remote in the config. See [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       Here’s where things get tricky and more specific. The pruning feature doesn’t actually care about branches, instead it’ll prune local ←→
       remote-references as a function of the refspec of the remote (see [4m<refspec>[24m and CONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES above).

       Therefore if the refspec for the remote includes e.g. [1mrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*[22m, or you manually run e.g. [1mgit fetch --prune [4m[22m<name>[0m
       "refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*" it won’t be stale remote tracking branches that are deleted, but any local tag that doesn’t exist on the remote.

       This might not be what you expect, i.e. you want to prune remote [4m<name>[24m, but also explicitly fetch tags from it, so when you fetch from it you
       delete all your local tags, most of which may not have come from the [4m<name>[24m remote in the first place.

       So be careful when using this with a refspec like [1mrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*[22m, or any other refspec which might map references from multiple
       remotes to the same local namespace.

       Since keeping up-to-date with both branches and tags on the remote is a common use-case the [1m--prune-tags [22moption can be supplied along with
       [1m--prune [22mto prune local tags that don’t exist on the remote, and force-update those tags that differ. Tag pruning can also be enabled with
       [1mfetch.pruneTags [22mor [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.pruneTags [22min the config. See [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       The [1m--prune-tags [22moption is equivalent to having [1mrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/* [22mdeclared in the refspecs of the remote. This can lead to some
       seemingly strange interactions:

           # These both fetch tags
           $ git fetch --no-tags origin 'refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'
           $ git fetch --no-tags --prune-tags origin

       The reason it doesn’t error out when provided without [1m--prune [22mor its config versions is for flexibility of the configured versions, and to
       maintain a 1=1 mapping between what the command line flags do, and what the configuration versions do.

       It’s reasonable to e.g. configure [1mfetch.pruneTags=true [22min [1m~/.gitconfig [22mto have tags pruned whenever [1mgit fetch --prune [22mis run, without making
       every invocation of [1mgit fetch [22mwithout [1m--prune [22man error.

       Pruning tags with [1m--prune-tags [22malso works when fetching a URL instead of a named remote. These will all prune tags not found on origin:

           $ git fetch origin --prune --prune-tags
           $ git fetch origin --prune 'refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'
           $ git fetch <url-of-origin> --prune --prune-tags
           $ git fetch <url-of-origin> --prune 'refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'

[1mOUTPUT[0m
       The output of "git fetch" depends on the transport method used; this section describes the output when fetching over the Git protocol (either
       locally or via ssh) and Smart HTTP protocol.

       The status of the fetch is output in tabular form, with each line representing the status of a single ref. Each line is of the form:

            <flag> <summary> <from> -> <to> [<reason>]

       When using [1m--porcelain[22m, the output format is intended to be machine-parseable. In contrast to the human-readable output formats it thus prints
       to standard output instead of standard error. Each line is of the form:

           <flag> <old-object-id> <new-object-id> <local-reference>

       The status of up-to-date refs is shown only if the --verbose option is used.

       In compact output mode, specified with configuration variable fetch.output, if either entire [4m<from>[24m or [4m<to>[24m is found in the other string, it
       will be substituted with [1m* [22min the other string. For example, [1mmaster -[22m> [1morigin/master [22mbecomes [1mmaster -[22m> [1morigin/*[22m.

       flag
           A single character indicating the status of the ref:

           (space)
               for a successfully fetched fast-forward;

           [1m+[0m
               for a successful forced update;

           [1m-[0m
               for a successfully pruned ref;

           [1mt[0m
               for a successful tag update;

           [1m*[0m
               for a successfully fetched new ref;

           !
               for a ref that was rejected or failed to update; and

           [1m=[0m
               for a ref that was up to date and did not need fetching.

       summary
           For a successfully fetched ref, the summary shows the old and new values of the ref in a form suitable for using as an argument to [1mgit log[0m

           The first command fetches the [1mmaint [22mbranch from the repository at [1mgit://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git [22mand the second command uses
           [1mFETCH_HEAD [22mto examine the branch with [1mgit-log[22m(1). The fetched objects will eventually be removed by git’s built-in housekeeping (see [1mgit-[0m
           [1mgc[22m(1)).

[1mSECURITY[0m
       The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
       shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious peer, your best option is to store it in another repository. This
       applies to both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a server are not effective for read access control; you should only grant
       read access to a namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire repository.

       The known attack vectors are as follows:

        1. The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to
           optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn’t required to
           send the content of X because the victim already has it. Now the victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X
           back to the attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the
           namespace the client has access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it on a client is to "merge" X into a
           public branch and hope that the user does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server without noticing the merge.)

        2. As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker
           falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against X. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to
           the attacker.

[1mCONFIGURATION[0m
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the [1mgit-config[22m(1) documentation. The content is the same as what’s
       found there:

       fetch.recurseSubmodules
           This option controls whether [1mgit fetch [22m(and the underlying fetch in [1mgit pull[22m) will recursively fetch into populated submodules. This
           option can be set either to a boolean value or to [4mon-demand[24m. Setting it to a boolean changes the behavior of fetch and pull to recurse
           unconditionally into submodules when set to true or to not recurse at all when set to false. When set to [4mon-demand[24m, fetch and pull will
           only recurse into a populated submodule when its superproject retrieves a commit that updates the submodule’s reference. Defaults to
           [4mon-demand[24m, or to the value of [4msubmodule.recurse[24m if set.

       fetch.fsckObjects
           If it is set to true, git-fetch-pack will check all fetched objects. See [1mtransfer.fsckObjects [22mfor what’s checked. Defaults to false. If
           not set, the value of [1mtransfer.fsckObjects [22mis used instead.

       fetch.fsck.<msg-id>
           Acts like [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m, but is used by [1mgit-fetch-pack[22m(1) instead of [1mgit-fsck[22m(1). See the [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m documentation for details.

       fetch.fsck.skipList
           Acts like [1mfsck.skipList[22m, but is used by [1mgit-fetch-pack[22m(1) instead of [1mgit-fsck[22m(1). See the [1mfsck.skipList [22mdocumentation for details.

       fetch.unpackLimit
           If the number of objects fetched over the Git native transfer is below this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into loose object
           files. However if the number of received objects equals or exceeds this limit then the received pack will be stored as a pack, after
           adding any missing delta bases. Storing the pack from a push can make the push operation complete faster, especially on slow filesystems.
           If not set, the value of [1mtransfer.unpackLimit [22mis used instead.

       fetch.prune
           If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the [1m--prune [22moption was given on the command line. See also [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.prune [22mand the
           PRUNING section of [1mgit-fetch[22m(1).

       fetch.pruneTags
           If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the [1mrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/* [22mrefspec was provided when pruning, if not set already. This
           allows for setting both this option and [1mfetch.prune [22mto maintain a 1=1 mapping to upstream refs. See also [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.pruneTags [22mand the
           PRUNING section of [1mgit-fetch[22m(1).

       fetch.all
           If true, fetch will attempt to update all available remotes. This behavior can be overridden by passing [1m--no-all [22mor by explicitly
           specifying one or more remote(s) to fetch from. Defaults to false.

       fetch.output
           Control how ref update status is printed. Valid values are [1mfull [22mand [1mcompact[22m. Default value is [1mfull[22m. See the OUTPUT section in [1mgit-fetch[22m(1)
           for details.

       fetch.negotiationAlgorithm
           Control how information about the commits in the local repository is sent when negotiating the contents of the packfile to be sent by the
           server. Set to "consecutive" to use an algorithm that walks over consecutive commits checking each one. Set to "skipping" to use an
           algorithm that skips commits in an effort to converge faster, but may result in a larger-than-necessary packfile; or set to "noop" to not
           send any information at all, which will almost certainly result in a larger-than-necessary packfile, but will skip the negotiation step.
           Set to "default" to override settings made previously and use the default behaviour. The default is normally "consecutive", but if
           [1mfeature.experimental [22mis true, then the default is "skipping". Unknown values will cause [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m to error out.

           See also the [1m--negotiate-only [22mand [1m--negotiation-tip [22moptions to [1mgit-fetch[22m(1).

       fetch.showForcedUpdates
           Set to false to enable [1m--no-show-forced-updates [22min [1mgit-fetch[22m(1) and [1mgit-pull[22m(1) commands. Defaults to true.

       fetch.parallel
           Specifies the maximal number of fetch operations to be run in parallel at a time (submodules, or remotes when the [1m--multiple [22moption of
           [1mgit-fetch[22m(1) is in effect).

           A value of 0 will give some reasonable default. If unset, it defaults to 1.

           For submodules, this setting can be overridden using the [1msubmodule.fetchJobs [22mconfig setting.

       fetch.writeCommitGraph
           Set to true to write a commit-graph after every [1mgit fetch [22mcommand that downloads a pack-file from a remote. Using the [1m--split [22moption, most
           executions will create a very small commit-graph file on top of the existing commit-graph file(s). Occasionally, these files will merge
           and the write may take longer. Having an updated commit-graph file helps performance of many Git commands, including [1mgit merge-base[22m, [1mgit[0m
           [1mpush -f[22m, and [1mgit log --graph[22m. Defaults to false.

       fetch.bundleURI
           This value stores a URI for downloading Git object data from a bundle URI before performing an incremental fetch from the origin Git
           server. This is similar to how the [1m--bundle-uri [22moption behaves in [1mgit-clone[22m(1).  [1mgit clone --bundle-uri [22mwill set the [1mfetch.bundleURI [22mvalue
           if the supplied bundle URI contains a bundle list that is organized for incremental fetches.

           If you modify this value and your repository has a [1mfetch.bundleCreationToken [22mvalue, then remove that [1mfetch.bundleCreationToken [22mvalue
           before fetching from the new bundle URI.

       fetch.bundleCreationToken
           When using [1mfetch.bundleURI [22mto fetch incrementally from a bundle list that uses the "creationToken" heuristic, this config value stores the
           maximum [1mcreationToken [22mvalue of the downloaded bundles. This value is used to prevent downloading bundles in the future if the advertised
           [1mcreationToken [22mis not strictly larger than this value.

           The creation token values are chosen by the provider serving the specific bundle URI. If you modify the URI at [1mfetch.bundleURI[22m, then be
           sure to remove the value for the [1mfetch.bundleCreationToken [22mvalue before fetching.

[1mBUGS[0m
       Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in submodules that are present locally e.g. in [1m$GIT_DIR/modules/[22m. If the upstream adds a
       new submodule, that submodule cannot be fetched until it is cloned e.g. by [1mgit submodule update[22m. This is expected to be fixed in a future Git
       version.
